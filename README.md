# MyReads :books:

MyReads is an app that allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading or want to read. Users can also search for books and add books to their bookshelf.


## Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/tomajwinter/react-nanodegree-myreads.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
